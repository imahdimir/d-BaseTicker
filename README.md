Unique Base Tickers ever listed on [TSETMC.com](http://www.tsetmc.com)

# Assumption
I assumed that for each ticker on the [TSETMC](http://www.tsetmc.com) 
there is something I call it "**Base Ticker**". 
In other words, every ticker is built upon a corresponding **Base Ticker**
by a pattern.

For example:

- "خودرو1" is built by adding 1 to the Base Ticker "خودرو"
- "خودرو2" is built by adding 2 to the Base Ticker "خودرو"
- "خودروح2" is built by adding "ح" and then 2 to the Base Ticker "خودرو"
